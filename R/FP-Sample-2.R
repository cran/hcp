#'@title Change Point Estimation for Regression with Heteroscedastic Data
#'@description This is the footprint data set used in Ganocy and Sun (2014).
#'@format A 2-column vector containing 141 observations. The first column lists
#'the values (fp1x) at which the footprint pressure distribution curve
#'are measured, while the second column has the responses (fp1y), the
#'pressures obtained at the x's.
